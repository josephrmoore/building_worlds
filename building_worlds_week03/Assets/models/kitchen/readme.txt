- Bulb in overhead fan intake turns on when fan_switch is rotated 20 units in Y axis

- Main door rotates in Y axis.

- Both locks are run with set driven keys. Rotate the inner_knob and lock_handle (both in Z axis) and the knob_lock and deadbolt_lock move accordingly

-all compartments in fridge door and main body are correctly set up and ready to animate.
