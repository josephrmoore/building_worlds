Cobra Pogo Notes:

This is one of my first modelling projects with Maya. Created primarily using subdivision surfaces, the pogo also includes base materials. 

The scene file also has a rotational camera animation included, along with a missile that launches complete with smoke and other launch elements

Pogo is not textured or rigged.
